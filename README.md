## [Mobile Optimized Conf 2016](http://mo.dev.by/english.html): Let's be functional-reactive in Cocoa world
Most applications spend a lot of time waiting for events and processing them: Application expect user interaction with the interface, waiting for a response to a network request, expected completion of asynchronous operations, waiting for change dependent values. And only then react applications. These expectations and the reaction can be implemented in more ways. We become difficult to talk about them, to bind and create a high level in any form. But we can do better. Already known enough ReactiveCocoa framework is in great demand in iOS development, but not all know some of the features of working with him. In the report, I will talk about what has not been told before. Including: Multithreading and asynchronous with ReactiveCocoa ReactiveCocoa 2.5 vs. ReactiveCocoa 4. The main differences between the versions. ReactiveCocoa vs. RxSwift. Pros and cons.
